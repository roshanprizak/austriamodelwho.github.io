    "text": "What is Model WHO?\nThe World Health Assembly is an annual conference in which the Member States of WHO determine policies of the organisation with respect to a specific health agenda. For example, the 75th World Health Assembly was held in May 2022 on the theme: Health for peace, peace for health.\nModel World Health Organization (Model WHO) is a modified simulation of the World Health Assembly in which participants role-play as delegates of countries and as representatives of organization. They discuss and debate on health policies, and finally pass resolutions that advise and recommend member states on health policies. The theme for the October 2022 simulation was Energy Security and Health.\n\n\nWhen will Model WHO take place?\nThe next Model WHO will be conducted in person from 14th April to 16th April 2023. Follow us on social media and check our website to keep updated about future Model WHO events.\n\n\nWhere will Model WHO take place?\nThe April 2023 Model WHO will take place at the Karl Landsteiner University of Health Sciences in Krems.\n\n\nWhat is the difference between Model UN and Model WHO?\nThe Model United Nations (MUN) are simulations in which participants act as country representatives, and discuss and debate general conflicts in the world. In the Model WHO, the discussions are focussed on health policy. While other general issues are also discussed, the over-arching theme is health and healthcare.\n\n\nWho can join the Model WHO simulations? Do I need to have background in medicine or health?\nAnyone can join the Model WHO simulations. All you need is an interest in global health and health policy, and enthusiasm to discuss and learn! No experience and expertise is required. You will learn everything at the event and will get a chance to implement what you have learned.\n\n\nWhat will I gain by participating in a simulation?\nWith the growing importance of health policy discussions, it is imperative that students and young professionals within the field gain more hands-on experience in international policy debates and diplomacy to achieve health goals. At the end of the simulation, one walks away with invaluable experience in both. Also, it makes a great addition to one’s resume, no matter the career path.\n\n\nWhat happens at a Model WHO simulation?\nParticipants role-play as delegates of countries and as representatives of organizations at the “World Health Assembly”. Delegates discuss and debate on health agendas in regional blocks and produce draft resolutions. For example, delegates of the United States of America, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Bahamas, Ecuador etc. have their discussions within the PAHO (Pan American Health Organisation) region.\nThese resolutions are then presented in the plenary (with delegates from all regional blocks and non-state actors together). They are then debated to make amendements, and finally a decision is made collectively, to either pass them or reject each. The plenary sessions take place on the last day of the conference. In the April simulation, they would take place on the 16th April, Sunday.\n\n\nWhere and how can I register online?\nYou can register through the website of the Karl Landsteiner University. You first have to register an account with KL, and after receving an activation link, you can then register for Austria Model WHO with your details,\n\n\nWhat does the registration fee cover?\nThe registration fee enables the partipants to attend the conference for three whole days. It covers various things like (a) food and drinks at coffee and lunch breaks, (b) training for the debates during the conference, and (c) the social event on the final day.\n\n\nCan I attend the simulation online?\nModel WHO simulations are conducted both online and in-person. This April, we are conducting the simulation in person at the KL University. However, if there is enough interest in online participation, we will consider a hybrid setup.\n\n\nCan I only participate for one day?\nUnfortunately, that would not be possible as the simulation is designed to work as a three day event. What you do on day one will lead you to day two and on to day three, so a three day participation is not only ideal but also necessary.\n\n\nI want to join the organizing committee. Who should I contact?\nThat’s great! Write to us using the contact form, or at teamaustriamodelwho@kl.ac.at or teamaustriamodelwho@gmail.com.\n\n\nI’m interested in giving a talk at your event. Who should I contact?\nPlease contact us at teamaustriamodelwho@kl.ac.at or teamaustriamodelwho@gmail.com. We’ll get back to you to discuss the possibility.\n\n\n\nDiscuss. Debate. Make policies.

    "text": "Theme: Energy Security & Health\nHealth is one of the primary dimensions in which human security is threatened. The Social Pact of the United Nations contains the right to “highest attainable state of physical and mental health” as one of the economic, social and cultural rights, underlining the importance of health security as a way of promoting human security.\nAnother aspect of human security is energy security - the supply of low-cost, reliable, secure and sustainable energy sources to both the nation state and the individual. Energy vulnerability and energy insecurity are increasingly becoming a major threat to human security, owing to political conflicts, economic instabilities and climate change. The various social determinants of health - housing, education, air quality, cleanliness, nutrition, socio-economic status - depend on the energy sector to ensure a high quality of life. Health and energy are linked to each other, and the policies and behaviors of actors in one affect the other.\nHowever, in general, only a minor fraction of national public health policy frameworks consider climate change as a contributing factor. This lack of recognition prevents coordination and planning between the health sector and other ministries and sectors like water, energy, food and disaster risk management. An increased partnership within and between countries can play a crucial role in combating this under-recognized connection between energy insecurity and health.\n\n\nExpert talks\n\n\n\n\nProf. Dr. Matthias Klump\n\nGeorg-August-Universität Göttingen\nResearch areas: Sustainability in global supply chains, Digital production, Artificial intelligence and Human-Computer- Interaction (HCI)\n\nLearn more »\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Jawad Noon\n\nGeorg-August-Universität Göttingen\nResearch areas: Development Economics dealing with Medicine, Health Economics, Global Health, Health Technology, Data Science\n\nLearn more »\n\n\n\n\n\nOrganizing Committee\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Keerthi Dubbala\n\n\nKeerthi\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Bhagyshree Jamge\n\n\nBhagyshree\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Roshan Prizak\n\n\nRoshan\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Grünbacher\n\n\nSarah\n\n\n\n\n\nKabilan Sarala Vijayakumar\n\n\nKabilan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDhanlakshmi Shunmugam\n\n\nDhanlakshmi\n\n\n\n\n\nKatherina Tavernini\n\n\nKatherina\n\n\n\n\n\nNicole Sophie Brunner\n\n\nNicole\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Rahul Pisupati\n\n\nRahul\n\n\n\n\n\nGallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTestimonials\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParticipant 1\n\n I attended the Model WHO event organised in October, not knowing what to expect from such international conglomerations. From learning how to structure my speech and responses for the ongoing debates, attending this meeting helped me to write position papers and resolution papers. For those who want to improve their public speaking skills and sharpen their abilities to initiate international collaborations while debating, it is the best opportunity. I thank the Chair and all the organisers who put extra effort for creating an amazing opportunity that gave me an unforgettable experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParticipant 2\n\n Energy security and health is a challenging but pressing issue, that was selected as topic to introduce the audience to the model WHO concept. By representing either a country or a non-state actor, participants could experience first-hand the workflow of a typical WHO meeting. The process was very well organized and combined with selected presentations, to deepen the general understanding on the topic. It was a great experience to see how such global issues are discussed in the setting of a WHO meeting and how expert opinions and countries needs are considered to reach a common solution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParticipant 3\n\n I have delegated in Model United Nations before and was very glad to come across and participate in a Model WHO for the first time. I gained a lot of insights into the theme ‘Energy Security and Health’ as well as the functioning of WHO. I thoroughly enjoyed the whole simulation working alongside other delegates and non-state actors from different walks of life to discuss, debate, and work on the position papers and the resolution. The expert talks added a lot to the knowledge I gained from the simulation, looking forward to the April 2023 event!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscuss. Debate. Make policies.

On Friday and Saturday participants will engage in discussions within their regional blocks (EMR, SEAR, PAH etc), with countries they are connected to, geographically, economically and politically. Together they will write a draft resolution which they will then propose to all the member countries in a plenary session on Sunday. All the regional groups come together to debate and defend their resolutions. The resolutions that are passed make up the policies for ‘WHO’.

    "text": "The overarching goal of Austria Model WHO is to strengthen the global health community in Austria and build a network of future global health leaders.\nModel World Health Organisation (Model WHO) is a simulation of the World Health Assembly conducted at the World Health Organisation every year in Geneva, Switzerland. Participants act as Delegates of countries and get hands on experience in diplomacy and health policy making. Model WHO is inspired from the Model United Nations, which is popular across the world. Having participated in and having organised such conferences in the United Kingdom, we want to introduce this prestigious conference model to Austria. We want to conduct this event in Karl Landsteiner University of Health Sciences, Krems, and put Lower Austria on the map of International Global Health community."

    "text": "Project\nIn October 2022, we conducted a taster event online via Zoom as an introduction to Model WHO. The theme was “Energy Security and Health”. We had 10 participants who role played as delegates from EUR and SEAR region countries, and INGOs. We did a training session in the morning session along with two speaker talks. In the afternoon delegates engaged in policy debates and wrote two Draft resolutions. These resolutions were then discussed and passed by the plenary as a whole. It was a successful event. We are hopeful and excited to organise and conduct the next Model WHO in April in-person.\nIn April 2023, Austria Model WHO will conducted over a weekend - Friday to Sunday, on the theme “Climate Change and Health”. In the simulation, participants role play as the delegates of member countries, and act in the interest of their assigned countries. On Friday and Saturday participants will engage in discussions within their regional blocks (EMR, SEAR, PAH etc), with countries they are connected to, geographically, economically and politically. Together they will write a draft resolution which they will then propose to all the member countries in a plenary session on Sunday. All the regional groups come together to debate and defend their resolutions. The resolutions that are passed make up the policies for ‘WHO’. These discussions are enriched with speaker talks, and social events help promote network building. These debates give the participants first hand experience in health policy making in a simulated environment. This is a great opportunity for those interested in global health to meet their peers, discuss health policy and lay foundations for potential collaborations.\nRegistrations for the simulation “Climate Change and Health” are open right now!"
